# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
By adjusting the code to the PlanMyTrip App, I've added a weather description to the pop-up markers. This can be used in junction with the Google Maps Directions API to chart a trip through four cities.

## Results
As a beta test, we took a temperate trip through the UK. I set the minimum temperature as 40 degrees, and the maximum temperature as 70 degrees. I plotted a route through four cities using the Google Maps Directions API.

And with the markers layer map, we can see that the trip will be a cloudy, temperate adventure.
